# Here you can set your custom window rules
# Full documentation: https://wiki.hypr.land/Configuring/Window-Rules

# General syntax:
# windowrule = RULES..., matchers...
#
# Notes:
# - Matching is case sensitive ("firefox" ≠ "Firefox").
# - Regex must match the full string (use .* if needed).
# - Rules are applied from top to bottom.

# --- Matchers ---
# class:<regex>            match window class
# title:<regex>            match window title
# initialClass:<regex>     match initial class (at window creation)
# initialTitle:<regex>     match initial title (at window creation)
# xwayland:<0|1>           match XWayland or native Wayland windows
# workspace:<id|name>      match windows on a specific workspace
# floating:<0|1>           match floating or tiled windows
# fullscreen:<0|1>         match fullscreen windows
# pinned:<0|1>             match pinned windows
# focus:<0|1>              match focused/unfocused windows
# monitor:<id|name>        match by monitor
# content:<type>           content type: none, photo, video, game
# tag:<tagname>            match by tag

# --- Rules (actions) ---
# float                    force window to float
# tile                     force window to tile
# fullscreen                make window fullscreen
# maximize                  maximize the window
# move <x> <y>              move floating window (px or %)
# size <w> <h>              set floating window size
# center                    center floating window
# monitor <id|name>         move window to a specific monitor
# workspace <id|name>       open window on a specific workspace
# workspace silent <id>     move silently (no focus)
# noinitialfocus            disable initial focus on open
# pin                       pin window on all workspaces
# opacity <active> [inactive] [fullscreen] set window opacity
# noborder                  disable window borders
# noblur                    disable blur effect
# nofocus                   disable focusing
# bordercolor <colors>      override border colors
# animation <style> [opt]   set specific animation style
# idleinhibit <mode>        inhibit system idle (fullscreen, always, none)
# nodim                     disable dimming when inactive
# unset                     remove or override an existing rule

# Vibranium comes with pre-installed tags that you can use to assign rules directly to groups of windows.
# This includes tags such as:
#
#	- office, which includes the entire Libre Office application suite, Obsidian, PDF viewers
#	- game, which consists of a fairly large regex expression and must match a huge number of game windows
#	- gamelauncher, which includes the most popular game launchers, such as Steam, Heroic, Lutris, Prismlauncher, etc.
#	- work, which includes applications such as Gimp, Krita, Inkscape, Kdenlive, and Virt-manager.
#	- browser, which includes almost all popular browsers.
#
# Vibranium also applies special rules for windows that require user interaction right out of the box.
# This list typically includes windows that ask the user to:
#	- Confirm an action
#	- Save an unsaved file
#	- Password prompt (polkit)
#	- Delete files
#
# When this rule is triggered, windows of this type will open in floating mode with a red window frame and dim the entire screen. 
# You can associate this with the UAC window in Windows.
#
# 
# Vibranium will also automatically activate certain windows that require attention. 
# These include:
#	- All windows with the browser tag
#	- Spotify. This is useful when you follow a link from your browser — Spotify will request 
#		attention and Hyprland will automatically switch the active workspace to it

# Here is an example of how you can reassign an entire tag to a specific workspace:
# windowrulev2 = workspace 2,  tag:office
# windowrulev2 = workspace 3,  tag:browser
# windowrulev2 = workspace 8,  tag:work
# windowrulev2 = workspace 9,  tag:gamelauncher
# windowrulev2 = workspace 10, tag:game
# Which will open all windows with the game tag on Workspace number 10,
# all office applications on Workscape 2, and so on.

# All changes here are applied instantly.
