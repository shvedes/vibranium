# This script displays the currently playing track from either a Playerctl-compatible
# media player or MPD (Music Player Daemon). It can:
# 1. Output the track title and artist to the terminal.
# 2. Format the output for the Hyprland lock screen if run with --hyprlock.
# 3. Optionally download and show the album art if enabled in Vibranium settings.
# 4. Send a desktop notification with the track information and album art.
# The script checks which player is currently active, retrieves metadata, formats it
# using Pango markup for notifications or lockscreen display, and cleans up temporary
# album art files afterward.
